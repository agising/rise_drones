|SEN| API
========================

.. index:: SEN, Snesor Safety System

The |SEN| is a middleware that makes it easy to interact with sensors in
differnet ways. A SEN is much like a DSS, it responds to requests, has publish
ports for different streams, has an owner and registers to the |CRM|. The |SEN|
offers applications to connect and control a sensor via an unified API. The
|SEN| currently supports raspberry pi cam.

The |SEN| takes care of the low level functionality. An application software
connects to the |SEN| and requests sensorinformation. Applications can be
written in any language and be hosted anywhere on the network. The communication
library ZeroMQ is used to share information between entities independent on
architecture and code base.

If the application disconnects or loses link, the CRM will take back the
ownership. Some requests requires the requestor to be the owner of the sensor,
refer to API description.

The final component in the figure below is the Central Resource Manager (CRM).
The CRM is mainly responsible for managing the available drone resources to
applications. However, it can also launch a new application to control a drone
or a sensor if the previous application owner for some reason loses connection
to the drone during flight. Nowdays we strive to use the CRM for all
applications and scenarios. It is the default option, however it is still
possible to run applications without the CRM if they are developed to support
it.

  Rise Drones platform architecture overview

Communication
--------------

.. index:: SEN, Communication

The |SEN| offers three external interfaces towards an application. To
support any code base in the application, commands are encoded in
serialised JSON objects and transferred via zeroMQ library.

- SEN Ctrl Reply-socket where the application can call functions and
  receive ack/nack and information

- Info Publish-socket where data streams can be published, e.g.
  autopilot state data

- Data Publish-socket for bigger data structures, e.g. photos

Available commands are described in :ref:`sencontrolAPI`.

The socket ports for non CRM operations are described below. In CRM
operations the CRM will present the ip and Ctrl-Reply-socket port for
each client, and the publish ports can be requested by directly
connecting to the client of interest and issuing get_info. The sockets
are open for all connecting ip-numbers.

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Sockets port definition if **NOT** using CRM
  :linenos:

  {
    "Ctrl-Reply-socket": 5557,
    "Info-Publish-Socket": 5558,
    "Data-Publish-Socket": 5559
  }

Each function call must include an application id. This is because
each SEN is owned by someone (application id), and that the owner has
higher level permissions than non-owners. Some commands requires that
the command is sent from the SEN owner in order to be acknowledged by
the SEN, while some commands can be used by everyone. This is
explained in more detail in the Nack reasons for each command in the
API.

In scenarios where CRM is used the application id is distributed by
the CRM in the setup phase. In scenarios without CRM, the application
must use the default application id :python:`"da000"`.

Coordinate system
-----------------

The sensor coordiante system is defined by the camera center line in reference
to the horizontal plane and true north. The center line projected in the
horizontal plane relative true north defines the yaw, the angle between the
horizontal plane and the center line defines the pitch angle and the agnle
between image horizontal axis and the horizon defines roll angle.



.. _sencontrolAPI:

SEN Ctrl-link API
-----------------

.. index:: SEN; Ctrl-link API

General
~~~~~~~

The ZeroMQ REQ/REP interface takes function calls as JSON objects with
two mandatory keys, :python:`"fcn"` and :python:`"id"`, the string
values are the function name and the application id. Additional keys
are described in this API chapter. Each function call gets confirmed
with an ack or a nack where the key :python:`"call"` holds the name of
the calling function. A generic example follows:

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Generic function call from application to |SEN|
  :linenos:

  {
    "fcn": "<function name>", "id": "<requestor id>"
  }

Response from |SEN| is an ack or a nack. The key :python:`"call"`
carries the name of the function called. Some functions uses the ack
reply to transfer data, which can be seen in the listings of the API
below. A nack includes the key :python:`"description"` that carries a
nack description string.

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Generic response: ``ack``
  :linenos:

  {
    "fcn": "ack",
    "call": "<function_name>"
  }

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Generic response: ``nack``
  :linenos:

  {
    "fcn": "nack",
    "call": "<function name>",
    "description": "<Nack reason>"
  }


Fcn: ``heart_beat``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. compatibility:: badge
  :py-client: verified

The |SEN| tracks the activity from the application to survey if the
application is still alive. Each and every function call from
the application to the |SEN| acts as a heartbeat. If no other messages
are sent from the application to the |SEN|, the application shall call
the ``heart_beat`` function to maintain the link integrity. The link
is considered degraded after 5 seconds and lost after 10 seconds.

The link lost behaviour differs depending on if the |CRM| is used or not as
described below.

|CRM| not used behaviour:
_________________________

The |SEN| will do nothing.

|CRM| is used behaviour:
_________________________

The |SEN| will notify the CRM using the function `app_lost`. If it receives an
ack, the |SEN| will reset the lost link counter. In the meantime the |CRM| will
launch an application that claims ownership of the |SEN| and will send heart
beats and try to land the SEN (heritage from DSS). If the lost link counter
reaches the limit for the second time without receiving any heartbeats in
between the |SEN| will engage the autopilot implementation of RTL (heritage from
DSS).


If it receives a nack (or no response) |SEN| will do nothing.

.. code-block:: json
  :caption: Function call ``heart_beat``
  :linenos:

  {
    "fcn": "heart_beat",

The SEN responds to the ``heart_beat`` function call with an ack.
